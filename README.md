ยง Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)
I have tried to create a flower with different shapes and colors. I like to try different color combinations with the same color level and just create something nice to look at. I thought it would be nice to create a throbber with a twist. A throbber that does not look a lot like a regular throbber.  
			
ยง How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?
I think we can use programming to reflect the digital culture by creating something that is a trend so it can be compared to the visual culture where the trend also appears. Like if a colour is very very popular or a shape it could affect the result of creating something with programming. So therefore it can be a reflection of the time it could be or was. 
			
We live in a digital world which has an effect on how we experience life; the things we see and the things we feel and that is why the digital culture is very guiding  to us. 
From the book "Executing Practices" from the chapter "Executing Micro-temporality" on page 91 it says that:
			
   "A throbber represents the speed of network traffic that is also tied to our affective states and perception of time.      Emotionally, it can be frustrating to encounter buffering, as it involves interruption.Things do not flow smoothly and users become impatient in waiting for an unknown period of time or for something yet to come."
			
Which indicates that by programming you can make an effect on the user's feelings, perception of time and the user can therefore get frustrated and impatiant. By using programming you can create a throbber that has a effect on the user in many ways.
